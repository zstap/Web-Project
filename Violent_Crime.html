            <p>  A violent crime is when someone physically hurts or threatens to hurt someone, and also includes crimes where a weapon is used. The police will record a crime as violent if the offender clearly intended or intends to physically harm you, regardless of whether or not it results in a physical injury. </p>
            <p>Violent crimes can happen in public spaces such as in the street, clubs and pubs, as well as at home or in the workplace, and often the victim knows the person who attacks them. The important thing to remember is that it’s not your fault – you haven’t done anything wrong, and it’s the person who has been violent that is to blame. No-one has the right to hurt you.</p>
