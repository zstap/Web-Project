        <p> Most vehicle crime is preventable. It can take as little as 10 seconds for a thief to steal something from your car. The best way to protect your belongings is to lock your car whenever you leave it. </p>

        <p>Where you park can make a big difference to the safety of your car and your belongings. Look out for car parks approved by the police Safer Parking (opens in a new window) scheme. You can find them by looking for their distinctive 'Park Mark' signs.
